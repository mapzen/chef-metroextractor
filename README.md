Metroextractor Chef
===================
![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/mapzen/chef-metroextractor.svg?style=svg)

Attribution
-----------
Heavily influenced by Mike Migurski's [Extractotron](https://github.com/migurski/Extractotron/)

What does it do?
----------------
Downloads the latest planet in pbf format.
Produces, via osmconvert or vex, a number of metro extracts in both pbf and bz2 formats.
Produces shape files in both imposm and osm2pgsql formats.

Projections
-----------
GeoJSON is generated via ogr2ogr and output in CRS:84 (e.g. EPSG:4326) projection.

Imposm shapfiles are generated in EPSG:4326.

What hardware do I need?
------------------------
This depends on a few factors:
  - what backend processing system for extracts do you want to use? We support vex and osmconvert.
  - if you're using vex, do you have enough memory to store the planet in RAM?
  - if osmconvert, how many cores do you have and how fast are they?

The short version is that this could take anywhere from a few hours to days depending on setup and hardware .

If you'd rather not go that route, you're in luck. We'll be producing extracts weekly, and you can find
them here: [Mapzen Metro Extracts](https://mapzen.com/metro-extracts/)

Contributing
------------
Extract creation is driven off the cities.json file found here: [metroextractor-cities](https://github.com/mapzen/metroextractor-cities).
If you'd like to add an extract, you can either update the file directly if you feel comfortable doing so and submit a pull request,
or open a GitHub issue and we'll look into doing it for you.

If you'd like to update any other code, please fork, update, write specs for your changes and submit a pull.

#### Note
* running a planet download and then processing extracts on your local machine might be hit or miss (likely miss)

#### I don't like Vagrant
* well then sir, provision an Ubuntu12.04 LTS system with the provider of your choice, and then bootstrap with chef-solo:
    `knife solo bootstrap root@${host} -r 'recipe[metroextractor]'`
* and re-cook with the following:
    `knife solo cook root@${host} -r 'recipe[metroextractor]'`
* alternatively, you can add the metroextractor cookbook to your chef server and wrap it as you see fit
